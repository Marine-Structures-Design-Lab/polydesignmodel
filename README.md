# polydesignmodel

The intent of the polynomial design model is to observe how well different sequences of design activities, or paths, are able to converge on a successful design and to observe how burdened designers later in a sequence become because of analysis order and previous input variable (more specifically, independent variable) assignements.  The specific variables, analyses, and paths of the polynomial model can be found by reading the "Simulating Design Paths" chapter of the prospectus report at the following link: [link].

Several variations of python code were created for the polynomial design model in the build-up of its final variations.  In the version saved here in the Python code folder, the variations having a "4" in the name are the most updated files.  The version with a "3" in the name is from an earlier version, but code from it may still be useful.  The difference in the regular and experience versions mainly have to do with the random variable assignments of the independent variables of each path; the regular version primarily has uniform random variable assignments, while the experience version primarily has normal random variable assignments.  The files in this folder are less up-to-date than the prospectus version.  But in the chaos of running cases for the PRADS report and my prospectus, I got lost with what is what in the GitHub folder.
